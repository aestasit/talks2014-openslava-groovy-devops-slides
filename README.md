# Groovy DevOps in the Cloud

Slide deck of presentation "**Groovy DevOps in the Cloud**" given at **OpenaSlava** (Bratislava), *2014* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> Talk focuses on a set of tools to automate the provisioning of (cloud) servers using Groovy libraries and Gradle plugins. We explore how to leverage those to create an infrastructure for building, configuring and testing the provisioning of boxes in the cloud - elegant and groovy. Java/Groovy developers interested in reusing their existing skills for infrastructure provisioning and learning more about problems encountered during system operations should come to this presentation.
